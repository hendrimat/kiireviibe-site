# Site "Kiire Viibe"

This is an interactive [site](https://hendrimat.github.io/kiireviibe-site/) created for the purpose of aiding in learning estonian fingerspelling signs. The webpage is inspired by touch-typing sites a la "monkeytype" and relies on a Google Mediapipe machine learning model for hand gesture recognition. It was created for the 2023 University of Tartu course "Introduction to Data Science". 
 
The code for the machine learning project and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Karl-Kristjan-Puusepp/EstonianFingerspellingSigns/tree/main)
